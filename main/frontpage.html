      <h2>ASTAR ALGORITHM</h2>
      <h3>What is the Astar algorithm?</h3>
      <p>It's a searching algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points on a graph or map. Astar is commonly applied in route planning and navigation systems to determine the most efficient path.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="algorithm" data-page="algorithm2.html">
      <h2>CLUSTERIZATION ALGORITHM</h2>
      <h3>What is the Clusterization algorithm?</h3>
      <p>This algorithm is used to group similar data points together into clusters or categories based on certain characteristics or features. It's widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and pattern recognition tasks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="algorithm" data-page="algorithm3.html">
      <h2>GENETIC ALGORITHM</h2>
      <h3>What is the Genetic algorithm?</h3>
      <p>Inspired by the process of natural selection, genetic algorithms are optimization techniques used to solve problems by simulating the process of evolution. They're employed in various fields, including optimization problems, machine learning, and evolutionary computation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="algorithm" data-page="algorithm4.html">
      <h2>ANT ALGORITHM</h2>
      <h3>What is the Ant algorithm?</h3>
      <p>Modeled after the behavior of ants searching for food, ant algorithms are used for solving complex optimization problems, especially those related to graph theory and network routing. They're particularly effective in finding optimal paths in networks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="algorithm" data-page="algorithm5.html">
      <h2>DECISION TREE ALGORITHM</h2>
      <h3>What is the Decision Tree algorithm?</h3>
      <p>Decision tree algorithms are used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning. They build a tree-like model of decisions based on features of the data, making them interpretable and useful for both classification and regression problems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="algorithm" data-page="algorithm6.html">
      <h2>NEURAL NETWORK ALGORITHM</h2>
      <h3>What is the Neural Network algorithm?</h3>
      <p>Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They're used for tasks such as pattern recognition, classification, regression, and other complex learning tasks, making them fundamental in various domains like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.</p>
